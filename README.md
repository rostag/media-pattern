# media-pattern

The idea is to semi-automate video composing by assigning each video fragment key characteristics, like:

- Subject / meaning
- Motion
- Camera Position
- Relative size
- Coloring

Each video fragment then can participate in rhythmical composition where key characteristics are used as phythm carriers medium.
